Ultra-cinematic wide shot inside a late-19th-century mechanical workshop (1886).
The modern car from the reference image is being assembled in a completely anachronistic environment. No robots, no electricity. Instead — wooden floors, brick walls, iron beams, steam-powered machinery.
Blacksmith-style craftsmen in 19th-century work clothing (leather aprons, rolled-up sleeves, suspenders) manually shape metal parts using hammers, anvils, and primitive mechanical presses. Steam rises from machines. Belts and pulleys rotate overhead, driven by a central steam engine.
Oil lamps and early gas lights illuminate the space with warm, flickering light. The contrast between the modern car design and primitive tools is visually striking.
Camera: slow cinematic pan, wide framing. Color grading: warm sepia tones, historical atmosphere, subtle film grain.
